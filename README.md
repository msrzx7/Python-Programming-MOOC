This repository contains my solutions, personal notes and practicing examples etc. from the
University of Helsinki Python Programming MOOC:
https://programming-24.mooc.fi/
## Exercises and Model Solutions : https://programming-24.mooc.fi/all-exercises

## Goals
- Build strong Python fundamentals
- Develop problem-solving skills
- Prepare for Data Science and Machine Learning

## Structure:
It closely follows the course structure but it can be little different because of my personal notes and solutions

Each folder contains Python solutions and notes documenting
what I learned and mistakes I made.

## Note
These are my own solutions and notes.
If you're taking the course, try solving the exercises yourself first.
